# IMU-Sensor Calibration

Used Simple Python functions to compute Least Square method for estimating constant parameters and generate Allan variance plot 
for estimating random noise parameters from it. 

The application in mind was analysis of Deterministic Error & Stochastic Error in inertial measurment unit.
