# IMU-Sensor Calibration

Used Simple Python functions to compute Least Square method for estimating constant parameters and generate Allan variance plot 
for estimating random noise parameters from it. 

Programed state space model of the system in Python by collecting the real time data from different sensors and generating gaussian descriptions of the noise present

The application in mind was analysis of Deterministic Error & Stochastic Error in inertial measurment unit.
